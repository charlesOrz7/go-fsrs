Go module implements [Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler algorithm](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/free-spaced-repetition-scheduler)

## Usage

I'm developing a more useful module, the current module is only the algorithm implementation.

Please see [GoDoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-spaced-repetition/go-fsrs) and [Wiki](https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/go-fsrs/wiki) for documents.

**The Module Is in Very Early Stage, and It's Subject to Change**
